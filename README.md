# Clean API Starter in Node and Prisma

This repository is solely intended to provide a quick starter template for creating APIs with Node.

It includes only the basic Express setup with TypeScript and the first router.

## Installation

You can clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the project, use the standard command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Additional Notes

If you wish, itâ€™s a good idea to remove the current `origin` from the repository so you can add your own remote repository and continue development.

To view the remote repositories:

```bash
git remote -v
```

To change the origin:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <url>
```

Where `<url>` is the URL of your remote repository...
